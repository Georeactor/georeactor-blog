                in Rosalind Franklin's lab, an article appeared in the
                <i>Spartanburg Herald-Journal</i>'s Peach Edition – extolling
                the future of "<span class="quoted"

                When this article was written, cytogenetics - the study of
                chromosomes - was about to enter its midcentury heyday. Japanese
                scientists had duplicated rice chromosomes decades earlier, and
                Barbara McClintock was identifying transposable elements within
                chromosomes, work which would later win a Nobel Prize.

                Before I get too deep into history, I should acknowledge that

                and karyotyping is used to confirm chromosomal disorders during
                pregnancy. This page is more about a span of time when
                cytogenetics was the <b>primary</b> frame to understand
                genetics, and subject to attention (and hype?) in the media.
                Looking back, divining something from chromosomes without the
                ability to zoom in seems so small.

                <i>Cytogenetics and Cell Genetics</i> in 1973 and then the

                    Chromosomes were named in the mid-19th century for their
                    interesting coloring during staining. By the 1880s
                    scientists could look at these colorful wormy chromosomes
                    packed into the nucleus of a cell.<br /><br />

                Early research identified the X choromosome (1890-1901) and then
                Y chromosome (1905-1920) related to biological sex. They were
                noticed for behavior during meiosis, and not named not by shape.

            <h3>Incorporation into eugenics</h3>
            <p>
                Chromosomes become a major topic for scientists and in the
                eugenics movement.<br />
                In 1925, while announcing a new daughter in the Roosevelt
                family, one writer launches into a lesson on chromosome
                inheritance finishing with

            <h3>Colchicine craze</h3>
            <p>
                In 1937, it's discovered that colchicine, an old treatment for
                gout, can affect the mitosis of plant seeds and cause a whole
                genome duplication (WGD). The resulting plants, with twice as
                many chromosomes per cell, sometimes grow larger seeds, grains,
                and fruits.<br />
                Farmers and gardeners experiment with spraying their plants with
                colchicine.<br />
                Newspaper articles at the time suggest giant humans could be
                coming.<br />

                instituionalized patients and explain various conditions with
                their chromosomes. Allen Bartholomew found multiple Australian
                prisoners with XYY chromosomes - in 1968 he testified in the
                trial of Laurence E. Hannell that "<span class="quoted"
                    >every cell in his body and the brain is abnormal</span

                conditions warranting an insanity defense, and chromosomes were
                mentioned only once in the trial transcript.<br />A 1969 study
                found XYY men to be "<a

            <h2>Epilogue</h2>
            <p>
                As a non-expert, cytogenetics sounds like biology's version of
                "cybernetics", a field which presaged the path that science and
                research would take.<br />
                A lot of plans and promises didn't come to fruition. Polyploid

                >
                but seem to have never made it to Spartanburg. Research is
                ongoing into the genes for peach ripeness. Polyploid rice, which
                has usually been sterile, is getting reconsidered in connection
                with cross-breeding with wild relatives or gene editing.<br />
                The swift turnaround from discoveries in cytogenetics to
                testing, exclusion, and claims about violence is also
                remarkable. Only a few years separated finding the typical count
                of human chromosomes, and assuming that doctors could predict
                someone's criminality or longevity on a karyotype.

                    for the first time. You can learn a lot about the sciences

                    - it looks like ICRS was helpful to calculate the prevalance
                    / probability of mutations into the 1980s. It might be
                    better described as a data-sharing program? One of the
                    founders, R. Ellen Magenis, would identify Smith-Magenis
                    syndrome in 1986. I was picturing finding some overlap with people or institutions converting into the Human Genome Project, but unfortunately I found very few mentions or
                    citations of ICRS.
