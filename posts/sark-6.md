When all hope seemed lost, the Unicode Technical Committee agreed to add Sark to the emoji-sequences / Recommended 
for General Interchange files - these generally match what countries' flags are included in emoji fonts.

To be clear, this is for Unicode 16.0 / Fall 2024, so it's not being formalized this year and probably won't be in 
iOS fonts until sometime in 2025.

### Fallout

Adding Sark to the CLDR resulted in updates to a few CLDR libraries:

### Time to back another emoji?

In the coming year, is there time to back another, non-flag emoji?

The ones that I came up with just now are "cauliflower" and "screwpine" (a green-orange fruit known as "pandan" in 
the Marshalls, also present in the Maldives, related to pandan flavoring). I might reach out to someone about this.
