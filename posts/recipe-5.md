I returned home, and want to highlight both some interesting foods from the trip.
But also it's a recipe post so I can feature some foods I made right after I returned
to my home kitchen.<br/>
Instagram was pumping out lots of home recipe inspiration, but then I shared
some absurd croissants and now my feed is all franken-croissants. Croffles are a major
hit around Japan/Malaysia/Indonesia, and I ate a crookie in Vancouver... maybe it's
having a moment?

## Meals

### Elote Mac

I did a stovetop version, with mozzarella and gouda. Maybe the grated cheese
was elevating this enough, but I really liked the combo.

### Kañiwa Soup

https://vibrantwellnessjournal.com/2019/12/01/how-to-cook-with-kaniwa/

My first recipe using kañiwa. It's described as "baby quinoa" but it's more like poppy seeds which taste like quinoa.
I put 1/2 cup of kañiwa and 1/2 cup of quinoa into my rice cooker (which has a brown rice/quinoa setting) and then started preparing some veggies. I decided that they call for too much tumeric and greens, and could use a jalapeño.

This was good, but I notice that I haven't taken it back out of the fridge yet =\

### Korean Wing Inspired Cauliflower

Uses your rice vinegar, sesame oil, sambal, gochujang, multiple times in the oven, etc.

Mine came out more like a caramel crunch cauliflower and not veggie buffalo wings. I used Sriracha gochujang and the flour barely stuck to the florets,
so maybe I did it wrong.

### Shakshuka with Israeli/pearl couscous

https://www.livinginsugar.com/2018/08/shakshuka-with-israeli-couscous/

Finally used my jar of premade shakshuka sauce to make a half recipe. Cook couscous inside the tomato sauce
and then add eggs, pretty simple.

### Stuffed Shells

Yum.
A little tricky timing between draining the shells, cooling them, and then stuffing them right before
the oven heats up.

### Tuna Melt

https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021806-tuna-melt

The *New York Times* tuna melt with red onion, cornichon/gherkin pickles, whole grain mustard, and a slice of cheddar. I don't buy bread often and impulse-bought a loaf of "croissant toast" at Whole Foods - this was tasty and meant I didn't need to add butter to the pan.
Maybe the franken-croissant posts got to me.

## Asides

I got Bored Cow cultivated milk, seeds for purple tomato, and natto, but I didn't
try any of it yet. Watching *Julia* (the Hulu series about Julia Child).

# Takeaways from what I could think of as a food research tour (Hong Kong and Indonesia)

At 阿元來了 - 觀塘店 in Hong Kong: Taiwanese-style pork rice, tea egg, bok choy, preserved lemon.

<img src="/blog-images/plate-1.jpg"/><br/>

At Suzana Bakery in Surabaya, Indonesia: grated cheese on glazed donuts. They also had a cake thing which ChatGPT accurately suggested (from text description) was
a [serabi](https://food.detik.com/kue/d-5531829/resep-serabi-solo-yang-lembut-harum-kreasi-sasa).

<img src="/blog-images/plate-2.jpg"/><br/>

Other desserts: crumbled Oreo on roti canai from DEJAVU. Roti bolen from "French Bakery" - these are pastries generally packaged as a gift box with chocolate and banana fillings.

[Indomie / Mie Setan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0Vqb-cRn4s) from a restaurant named Mie Gacoan. You order a spice level 1–9, and get these wontons.

<img src="/blog-images/plate-3.jpg"/><br/>

Ayam Penyet Hijau from Warung Bu Kris. [Penyet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayam_penyet) means the chicken is crushed in the sambal.
The restaurant has 3,500 reviews and the location and dish are seen as a Surabaya classic. This dish didn't do it for me, though… was I wrong to get the green sambal?

<img src="/blog-images/plate-4.jpg"/><br/>

Tahu telur tek-tek -this is boiled egg, tofu, and some extras (in this case, potato, bean sprouts, shrimp chips) drowning in a peanut / satay sauce. Tek-tek refers to cutting with scissors. Doesn't photograph well. There's one stall which is supposedly very famous, but it was closed.

<img src="/blog-images/plate-5.jpg"/><br/>

I missed another Surabaya signature dish: bebek goreng (fried duck). I also failed to get kue lapis (a colorful layer cake) here, but did get it in Tanjung Pinang. Are they different by region?

Tempeh mendoan from Sakaw Coffee, Tawangmangu - these are flat tempeh sheets, battered and fried like fish & chips, served with some tangy sauce. I could see this doing well in the US.<br/>
After reviewing menu photos online, the other plate was likely nasi gudeg biasa? Each component was pretty unfamiliar.

<img src="/blog-images/plate-6.jpg"/><br/>

From Bangun Trisno, it's indomie (with broth this time) and satay kelinci (rabbit satay). This was a specialty of the mountain region, and during busy season it would be sold on the roadside.

<img src="/blog-images/plate-7.jpg"/><br/>

Not pictured: [ayam palekko](https://dailycookingquest.com/ayam-nasu-palekko-makassar-spicy-chicken.html), a spicy chicken curry which I got at Reza Coffee & Palekko, Makassar.
Mine was pleasantly spicy so they must have gone easy on me.
The internet tells me this dish is characteristic of the Bugis people of South Sulawesi.

**Maybe some of these dishes will show up in my kitchen and future recipe posts?**
