I returned home, and want to highlight both some interesting foods from the trip.
But also it's a recipe post so I can feature some foods I made right after I returned
to my home kitchen.<br/>
Instagram was pumping out lots of home recipe inspiration, but then I shared
some absurd croissants and now my feed is all franken-croissants. Croffles are a major
hit around Japan/Malaysia/Indonesia, and I ate a crookie in Vancouver... maybe it's
having a moment?

## Meals

### Elote Mac

I did a stovetop version, with mozzarella and gouda. Maybe the grated cheese
was elevating this enough, but I really liked the combo.

### Kañiwa Soup

https://vibrantwellnessjournal.com/2019/12/01/how-to-cook-with-kaniwa/

My first recipe using kañiwa. It's described as "baby quinoa" but it's more like poppy seeds which taste like quinoa.
I put 1/2 cup of kañiwa and 1/2 cup of quinoa into my rice cooker (which has a brown rice/quinoa setting) and then started preparing some veggies. I decided that they call for too much tumeric and greens, and could use a jalapeño.

This was good, but I notice that I haven't taken it back out of the fridge yet =\

### Korean Wing Inspired Cauliflower

Uses your rice vinegar, sesame oil, sambal, gochujang, multiple times in the oven, etc.

Mine came out more like a caramel crunch cauliflower and not veggie buffalo wings. I used Sriracha gochujang and the flour barely stuck to the florets,
so maybe I did it wrong.

### Shakshuka with Israeli/pearl couscous

https://www.livinginsugar.com/2018/08/shakshuka-with-israeli-couscous/

Finally used my jar of premade shakshuka sauce to make a half recipe. Cook couscous inside the tomato sauce
and then add eggs, pretty simple.

### Stuffed Shells

Yum.
A little tricky timing between draining the shells, cooling them, and then stuffing them right before
the oven heats up.

### Tuna Melt

The *New York Times* tuna melt with red onion, cornichon/gherkin pickles, whole grain mustard, and a slice of cheddar. I don't buy bread often and impulse-bought a loaf of "croissant toast" at Whole Foods - this was tasty and meant I didn't need to add butter to the pan.
Maybe the franken-croissant posts got to me.

## Asides

I got Bored Cow cultivated milk, seeds for purple tomato, and natto, but I didn't
try any of it yet. Watching *Julia* (the Hulu series about Julia Child).
