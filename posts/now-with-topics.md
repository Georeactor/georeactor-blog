I am starting to get the hang of Deno - I was able to add topics to posts, then have topic-specific pages and RSS feeds.

Because the UI is already functions / somewhat component-ized, I didn't need to rewrite a ton of code for it.

I put this together in Visual Studio - it's showing a lot of IDE-cruft around everything, so not my favorite env, but I'm making progress on using this, too.
