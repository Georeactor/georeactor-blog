Chronically online people may be familiar with the term 'BlueAnon' to mock conspiracies at the opposite political polarity of 'QAnon'. The two don't have equivalent followings, but ü§∑‚Äç <br/>
In the pushback to AI getting incorporated into everything, I notice a pattern which I want to label "LuddAnon", defined in three points:

- Major political events are *best* explained as someone blindly copying off an AI / LLM; any other aspect is almost irrelevant.
- A select few people know how to write prompts or find typos and formatting and 'prove' that content was AI-generated.
- When news breaks on social media, before any real reporting,  a flash conspiracy will develop linking it to AI

Notes

- AI use can lead to mistakes, just give it the same scrutiny as claims that someone copied from Wikipedia or used Google Translate.
<li>When lawyers and professors have made mistakes with AI, these are usually proven <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/01/15/stanford-artificial-intelligence-experts-credibility-shattered-fake-ai-judge-says/">with hallucinated sources</a>, not by testing if LLMs can be prompted to generate similar text or ideas.<br/>
Though ChatGPT can be more likely to use particular dashes, words, and lists, the <a href="https://futurism.com/trump-admin-accused-ai-executive-orders">discourse around AI in executive orders</a> was awfully weak or contradictory (typos)
</li>
- Once the tariff formula was discovered, the claims evolved to AI making the list of countries and territories (?) or the formula, or stealing the formula from someone who is a current Trump advisor. Maybe people want to dissociate the tariff numbers from 'real' political beliefs or calculations, but tariffs were [part of the 2024 campaign](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-comes-to-a-painful-realization-trump-was-serious-about-steep-tariffs-all-along-080044887.html),
staff had to put real trade numbers into spreadsheets and posters, and did people forget [the first term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration) ?
The *Washington Post* recently [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/trump-tariffs-reason-advisers/) on the real process where staff created multiple possible formulas and decided on one.
- One reason to push back on this is that AI detection based on vibes or shady software is [unfair to students](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/01/22/college-students-ai-allegations-mental-health/77723194007/). Also if you care about the political situation and misinformation, have sources for stuff.
- The South Korea [martial law case](https://gizmodo.com/investigators-say-south-korean-presidents-bodyguard-asked-chatgpt-about-martial-law-hours-before-coup-2000579056) found that a bodyguard asked AI about martial law, but this is more about establishing a timeline; the president had discussed martial law for months
- AI gets blamed for the federal government canceling grants,
 [firing and rehiring](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/robert-kennedy-doge-firing-musk-b2727179.html), and hiding web pages about the Enola Gay and Jackie Robinson. I don't know enough about DOGE's email inbox or AI claims to say whether or not they used an LLM, a script with a word list, or something even less advanced (for example, [this find and replace](https://bsky.app/profile/erininthemorning.com/post/3li3rg7gw522f))
