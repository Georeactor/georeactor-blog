## the story so far

In 2010 I put some belongings into my dorm's storage and flew home to New Hampshire. I never went back to Pittsburgh.

By the time my high school class had its 10-year 'online reunion', I was in Tokyo to present at a conference, then going to hike in Nepal, before starting a consulting job I'd lined up in New York. Whatever was going on with me, I'd resolved some career and diploma issues. At times I thought 2020, my drop-iversary, would be when things felt wrapped up. My former academic advisor had asked me some questions. Maybe I was getting invited back to speak?

As we all know, 2020 was not a year of inviting strangers back to campuses.

And when I pivoted into Machine Learning, I learned a lot about academic research. If I were interviewing web developers, I would just be confused if someone pointed to white papers or Arxiv links about CSS, but in Machine Learning it's all about that. Maybe in part because online demos and ML 'in the wild' became possible only recently?

In February 2021, the old GitHub Jobs page had a post from [Western Governors University](https://wgu.edu), an online school based in Utah. I swear that I saw it earlier, but it's the first appearance in my search history. A year later, an old post from a student appeared on Hacker News - he'd finished his degree [in one semester](https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/cs-degree/).

WGU has several of these programs for professionals (in the US) to do exactly this type of credential on their own schedule.

I already know that Software Engineering is closest to what I already know, and I could look into CS.

If you search YouTube there are some influencers (?) who show how to sign up, get maximum credit for prior work, do online courses ahead of time for cheap, etc.
WGU offers a great deal for military families, and people who know they can get a promotion at work.

## what do you get from this?

As someone without a diploma, I know that you absolutely must have one for:
- poorly-designed online job applications
- upper pay levels in government jobs (but not contractors!)
- skilled work visas (but not entrepreneur visas!)
- credit in a graduate-level certificate or degree program (you can maybe audit, and I heard rumors, but this appears to have be out of professors' hands in recent times)
- occasional but very creepy credentialism outside of the workplace, which my family and I really bought into back in the day ðŸ™ƒ

For me practically this translates into:
- In the past I've been interested in international GIS work, IDEO Tokyo, etc. - they have processes and I'd like to include these as options without the Drama of disclosing that it's going to be weird and different getting me there
- After some confusion, I left college off of my CV. But Google interviewed me after I listed my original college years in their system, and I thought maybe Meta wants that, too.
- I had a summer where I looked into *what is grad school* and wrote to the Serious Games course at Michigan State and OLPC people, told them all about OLPC, Arabic crosswords, etc. and they said sorry (+ some encouragement to finish).

If I reserve time and get a diploma in the next year, what changes for me?
- I live in Chicago now, and I don't expect global work anytime soon. I read some rumors that (France? the EU?) won't count online or accelerated degrees.
- WGU isn't super well-known, so if a company is big on credentialism or time commitments or GPAs, they will also not like this.
- Once we got past the initial failure, I'd describe my family's attitude toward my education status as 'puzzled' -- they haven't been on my case. When my younger brothers were in school there was some icky revisionism. I don't expect a big closure moment.

The surprise difference-maker here is **grad school**. If WGU won't win points on an application, maybe what I need to do is complete the undergrad, take a deep breath, then work on a solid graduate certificate or diploma. It could be somewhere with in-state tuition, hybrid classes, reputation - I don't know yet.

## what would I study in grad school?

- ML tech, or a specific field to do ML in
- an aggressively sociological counter-voice in ML
- forensic accounting (this was what pulled me back into thinking about grad schools again; it's probably not all spy vs. spy and FTX, but good for consulting $)
- genetic engineering, or other ag-tech and agronomics, there's an *Innovation Lab for Current and Emerging Threats to Crops*, cool right? Lots of programs in this space or variations here in the Midwest.

Less organized:
- someone suggested I could go to grad school in Europe, but that depends on accepting my diploma
- at IAEA I got a card from Oak Ridge Lab, and in Myanmar there was an NGO (IDEA.int) which flies around giving advice on writing constitutions, should I be choosing a major based on a dream internship
- urban planning? - I remember the conversation in Code for America where I first learned this is *mostly* a grad school thing. U. Illinois Chicago programs include city design (which expects arch. prereqs) and civic analytics (ohhhhh)
- some schools offer museum studies, so maybe I could have an 'in' there
- some other program where my research project is redistricting or OpenStreetMap or crypto so it's more record-keeping than schooling
- I read a bit on history of medicine, and comparative literature, but is it worth going to school for it
