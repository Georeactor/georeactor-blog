Today (20 February 2024) I traveled from Singapore to Johor Bahru (Malaysia) by bus, then continued to Kluang by train.
I didn't have experience with international transit crossings so I was doing some research and stuff, and this is my ideal detailed description of the process.
I went early on a weekday afternoon, so limited traffic.

Take buses and then an MRT train to one of the stations just south of JB Sentral and the causeway.
There are multiple bus lines to the border. Google Maps will change its mind about which station to disembark at, and which bus to take from one station,
based on what side of the street you're on you are and what minute you would get onto a bus.
Pick one route and stick to it (unless you are stuck waiting 15+ minutes for a bus).

Before starting your trip, fill in the Malaysia arrival card online: https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main<br/>
Use a credit card or mobile payment to tap onto the bus.<br/>
Someone got off the bus at the last Singapore stop, so leave room for people to come and go.<br/>
Buses wait with trucks for a bit before pulling into a plaza.<br/>
Tap out when exiting the bus.<br/>
Follow people up into the border facility.<br/>
When I got here, there were 8-12 stations for any country passport to scan and do camera/thumbprint stuff. If you entered Singapore at the airport, this should be familiar. In my experience this took a page and a half of my passport instead of the face page alone?<br/>
Post-facility, yellow "causeway" buses are arriving every few minutes. Tap on.<br/>
The bus goes into JB for several hundred meters before the first stop. No need to tap off.<br/>
In this facility, there are several desks to enter Malaysia and answer questions about when you're leaving.<br/>
After this, there is a currency exchange and a few turns headed to JB Sentral station.<br/>
Cross the pedestrian bridge over the taxis, etc. until you are in a large station/shopping center.<br/>
Turning left, you can use touchscreens to reserve a seat on a train. I was worried about the passport number or phone number being American or whatever but I just entered the info and didn't need need a texted code or anythinng. There's also an intercity train desk to talk to a person.<br/>
Continuing to that end of the station, you can see a bank of airport chairs, and gates A and B. For some reason a screen shows other departures but not Intercity train.<br/>
About 15 minutes before departure, there is a commotion and people go down to the train.<br/>
After the train departs, someone will scan your ticket.
