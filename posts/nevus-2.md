Today I met with a retina specialist to look at what's going on in my eye. After reviewing measurements, he pulled up a chair and asked, "do you remember which eye it's in?" He assured me that this nevus is small and flat, so other than its closeness to the optic nerve there's not much going on, and we can review it yearly.<br/>
I showed him a previous OCT, a cross-section of retina layers with an ominous looking bump, but I'd misunderstood the image and all was well.

Without much I could actively do about the problem in the past weeks, I'd already started a "bucket list" type document.  I made progress on:

- Planning to visit friends along the east coast on an upcoming trip (previously was a quick  trip around a family event).

- Booked a wellness retreat

- One of my goals was to put my map or art in a museum. Unexpectedly, some museum exhibit designers contacted me about a photo from my work in OLPC Marshall Islands. We exchanged emails about this in early 2021, but it left my mind entirely. This would appear in an information age exhibit in the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum wing in 2024. I'd still like to get a more imagined work in a museum.

- Tandem skydive and BASE jump programs have physical requirements, which is another motivation for me to work on health. I talked to someone (who's also never done this) and we agreed that a skydive would be better because it's a longer experience. I also looked into several places which do bungee jumps (including a "wet" bungee jump where you get dunked into the water).

- Someone in my network has a similar eye problem and has been avoiding following up (they move around a lot), so I told them about my positive outcome and encouraged them not to delay.

- Got around to trying recipes from the two cookbooks at home, made pasta with the pasta roller machine, etc.

- I reached out to someone about co-teaching a course!


I had planned to write an email to my brothers and struggled about whether to downplay this or summarize or ask them to pick bucket list items, but now that it feels like a lot of nothing, I can just tell them in person sometime.
