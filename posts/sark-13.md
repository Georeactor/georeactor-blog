OK I think this is the last Sark update until I actually visit (hopefully this year or next).<br/>
The first iOS 18.4 Beta release was on February 21st, but that didn't include emoji. Today (March 3rd) the second beta
gave us the first look at Apple's version of the Sark flag: https://blog.emojipedia.org/first-look-new-apple-emojis-in-ios-18-4-beta-2/

The major players have been doing a good job of keeping the lions firmly in the upper-left corner, after some clarification about overlap with the cross
(as in the Seigneur's flag).

iOS 18.4 will be generally available in April.
