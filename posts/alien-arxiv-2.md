After my first post on scientific pre-prints on alien life, [Aliens of Arxiv](https://mapmeld.medium.com/the-aliens-of-arxiv-c850e48a69eb), I was considering a follow-upâ€Š-â€Šmaybe focused on [self-replicating / Von Neumann probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft)â€Š-â€Šbut there were only a handful of authors in the space. Eventually I found more topics for completeness.

#### Background on Von Neumann probes and FermiÂ Paradox

An alien civilization determined to explore the universe might send out autonomous probes, which would land on planets and asteroids to harvest minerals and build more probes, and this exponential spread should search and/or mine the whole accessible universe.

If one alien civilization ever built their replicating probes, we should expect to see some (this was already discussed in 1980 paper [Extraterrestrial Intelligent Beings do not Exist](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1980QJRAS..21..267T)). This gets into the Fermi Paradox business of what makes reaching spacefaring civilization status so difficult, where I'm partial to prokaryote â†’ eukaryote (since it is so weird!), followed by 'scary space radiation / extinction events' or maybe 'coming out of evolution with some empathy' being the Great Filter.

As for humans' work on probes - in the 1970s, [Project Daedalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Daedalus) researched a proposal to build one interstellar craft in Jupiter's orbit. The mass of the ship would be about 1/2 of an aircraft carrier, 99% in fuel collected from the gas giant. This is the foundation for much space colonization research of the 70s-90s.

In 1980, Robert Freitas Jr. redesigned Daedalus as REPRO, a factory to land and manufacture new REPRO ships every 500 years. The ship was estimated to be 2x the mass and 100x the cost of Daedalus. To me this seems pessimistic. If your civilization could send out 10,000 one-use probes, you're covering way more ground than REPRO until you hit the exponential curve on a 7,000â€“10,000 year timeline.

Today Freitas works in nanotech manufacturing, so he probably has some thoughts on smaller probes. ðŸ¤”

A physics professor in Georgia (the country) has written multiple papers about Von Neumann probes. More recently he was second author on *Black holes as tools for quantum computing by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations*.

The model suggested here is a civilization with a Dyson Sphere around a star, which launches centimeter- or millimeter-size probes. Any larger, conventional probes need minerals which they'd only find on rocky planets and moons, which involves more taking off and landing, etc., so it would be better if you can create a nanobot which doesn't need so much.<br/>
If I understand this right, swarms of probes create some drag while traveling through space, which could affect luminosity in the star system or galaxy as a whole, but also the best technique would be to look for Dyson Spheres.

A plan to measure future interstellar objects with the new James-Webb telescope and figure out if 'Oumuamua type objects are solid or dust or nitrogen icebergs. Previously
we read that if 'Oumuamua objects are plentiful then it's highly unlikely that they could all be nitrogen icebergs; if so a great deal of galactic mass is in similar objects.

This paper is more about the frequency that Dyson spheres would be bombarded with meteors and other junk. It's less bad if you had some kind of Dyson ring, but still it would need constant maintenance. After a civilization decays, the sphere will eventually break up and have pieces adrift in the cosmos. Loeb, a proponent of the lightsail theory, seems open to interstellar objects being pieces of spheres maybe:

> Interestingly, the estimated size of `Oumuamua was about a hundred meters, potentially dictated by the bombardment rate of an old Dyson sphere.

This estimates of estimates of estimates thing is not worth including.

Two researchers at the Initiative for Interstellar Studies modernize proposals for self-replicating probes. Looking from 2020 they are able to cite studies on modular and self-assembling robots, 3D printing in space, on-asteroid mining and manufacturing, and AI. The goal is to design a 100kg probe which can manufacture things from asteroids. The basis is a partial replicator model from [NASA's Project RAMA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/reconstituting-asteroids-into-mechanical-automata/). It would carry computer chips rather than try to manufacture a chip fab.

I'm not sure if we should consider these Von Neumann probes if they are bringing a set number of chips and then petering out. But of all the papers this was the most detailed and practical-sounding.

I thought that this was (like a previous paper) discussing how to peek at future interstellar visitors, but Hibberd is proposing to launch a probe to slingshot around Jupiter and catch up to 'Oumuamua. Launch would be in 2030â€“2032 and intercept in the mid-2060s or 2070s (depending on resources and probe size).

The paper suggests astronomers are putting on the brakes until the opening of the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_C._Rubin_Observatory) in Chile in late 2024, fearing that 'Oumuamua is nothing special. A 2021 article estimates that it will find five interceptable objects per year (though interstellar objects were supposed to be very rare and finding one, now multiple, was unexpected).

This 2020 article in "Space Policy" sparked an ongoing coversation (with the authors' latest reply published in 2023). Essentially the authors argue that a country which successfully detects or messages aliens will gain a huge advantage, and may use that to represent humanity as they see fit, and to control access to alien technology. Only a few countries have the initial resources to broadcast a message.

I don't have access to the original, but responses complain that the authors call for regulation of current SETI/METI, improving facility security, and even treating these programs on the same level as WMD research.

One author also had a 2021 paper [Should We Lie to Extraterrestrials?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0265964621000321) which criticizes the content of the Voyager probes' Golden Records.

I am full of questions about why this paper came out of Newcastle University's Institute for Ageing, but OK.

Ceres is mentioned in the title because the asteroid belt is seen as a prime target for Von Neumann probes, and for an astronomical mystery which I didn't know about: [Bright spots on Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_spots_on_Ceres).

The cited theories for this include some wild scientific papers from the 70s: [The zoo hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0019103573901115).

Assuming that the probe replication introduces errors over time, the author estimates production falls off in a 225 light year radius around the origin (for context, the Milky Way is 100,000 light years across and 1,000 light years thick, so ~1/200,000th of our galaxy). This is an interesting problem but I would hope if someone sends out Von Neumann probes, they can also make radio beacons with instructions? The internet tells me that we're visible above background radiation for longer:

> military radar transmissions set up during the Cold War to detect incoming ballistic missiles have the power and frequency characteristics to be detected over hundreds of light-years


The author's final conclusions are that the exponential payoff of Von Neumann probe design takes much too long for finite-living aliens and their institutions (similar to what I was thinking earlier with REPRO). So rational actors are doing conventional science or have a bubble of Von Neumann probes around them, but apparently not including us.
