Last fall I invested in a variety of stocks instead of relying on Bitcoin. I developed a spreadsheet to track how much I gained or lost if I kept those original investments (ignoring that I would continue to trade, lol). **Note that this isn't financial advice; it's my own retrospective.**

Some of my investment still went into Bitcoin. I invested a week or so before FTX crashed the price, so I felt stupid. But by now it's +38% and was a great investment, so I feel stupid again.

### Stock buys which outperformed Bitcoin

$BOTZ, an ETF of robotics companies and NVIDIA

$NIB, Barclay Bank's cocoa ETN, which they somehow miscalculated and [closed in April]( https://www.etf.com/sections/daily-etf-watch/ipath-etn-redemptions-death-knell-wrapper) - then there is no new cocoa ETF, though I continue to see headlines about cocoa prices hitting record highs

$GOOGL, you know them. They got an edge on Bitcoin after latest quarterly earnings

$MOR (MorphoSys AG) is a biopharmaceutical. I bought these later in the year, when this stock and Bitcoin were both down. I put in only $60 and it's up 90% since then, oops.

### Stocks which outperformed $SPY

$SHAK (Shake Shack) -  great burgers, expanding a lot

$ISRG - surgical robots, one of the $BOTZ holdings

$UMMA - a newer halal investment ETF (has a lot in TSMC, Samsung, Shopify… so it's almost a tech ETF)

$WINN (Harbor Long Term Growers ETF) - tech, finance, Eli Lilly

$SFM (Sprouts Farmers Market) - I put some money into grocery store stocks and these guys did well. If I include other grocery stock buys ($HAIN, down ~30%), this wasn't such a great strategy.

$AAPL - you know them

$NUEM, $MINV, and $MEM - these have different strategies but their biggest holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and Chinese companies.

### Later in 2022, more stock buys which outperformed $SPY

$NFLX, you know them, they've been down and up a lot this year due to changes in the basic subscription and multi-home shared accounts.

$ARKF (Ark Fintech Innovation ETF) - the Ark people get so much shit from Unusual Whales Twitter, yet they did good here.

$IPO (Renaissance IPO ETF) - a newer-than-FAANG wave of internet companies such as Airbnb, Snowflake, Palantir, Coinbase

$HAPI (Harbor Corporate Culture ETF) - tech, finance, LLY somewhat similar to Harbor's $WINN.

$EXEL (Exelixis) -  does genomics drugs

$CRSP (CRISPR biotech) - gain depends a lot on when you bought, so it may be smarter to be in a broader ETF such as $ARKG?

$CMG (Chipotle)  - They went down a bit this week after quarterly earnings, but still up overall. This is an argument for fractional shares on a platform like Robinhood, since the cost per share is so high.

### A tangent on measuring performance on Robinhood

In early 2023 I moved most of my interest to Robinhood so I could invest in some leveraged stocks, but these aren't part of my 2022 calculation. You might wonder if my more recent trades are outperforming $SPY (+20% YTD). But I don't know, because Robinhood visualizes and calculates as if I put all my cash in at the start.

By definition I did better with $SPUU and $SPXL. I am currently happy with $SOXL (leveraged semiconductor stocks), Nvidia, Netflix, Doordash, Gingko Bioworks ($DNA), and ELF makeup ($ELF).

### A tangent on nanotechnology  ETFs

I originally invested in $TYNE, and that was outperforming $SPY when it closed in February. I moved funds to another ETF ($TINY) and various companies, which all looked good on paper. Later I was considering buying more $TINY and the Robinhood charts showed how rarely it was trading. I decided to exit $TINY and put the $ into various nanotech companies.

Like cocoa, it's strange that this is a successful industry that doesn't have popular ETFs.
