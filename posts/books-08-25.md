## 1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Eric Cline, 2014; 2021 edition)

This unexpected hit book by a professor investigates the Late Bronze Age Collapse, often blamed on a mysterious Sea Peoples. Last year Cline released a graphic novel and a sequel, *After 1177 B.C.: The Survival of Civilizations*.

For a short book, I was a little disappointed how the first half or more is spent on people discovering artifacts, then trade and revolts associated with it in the centuries before 1177 BC. This might be helpful to humanize ancient people, and I did consider how Minoans got through major natural disasters before the Sea People. But I ended up skipping ahead looking for some meatier content. There's brief discussion of a drought and reduction of international trade being more proximate of a cause than Sea Peoples looking for refuge.

## Creating the Qur'an: A Historical-Critical Study (Stephen J. Shoemaker, 2022)

I read a  Shoemaker book [two years ago](/books-09-23), and it was a good intro to outsider perspectives on early Islamic history. I had my own misconceptions, so it was interesting to follow the traditional history, this research, and YouTube videos side-by-side.

Uthman ibn Affan, the third Sunni caliph, is said to have compiled the canonical Qur'an within 20 years of the prophet's death. This was disputed by early Shia leaders, but has become the prevailing belief in Islam and in Western academia.<br/>
A "revisionist school" emerged in the 1970s, particularly with the book [*Hagarism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagarism). To summarize their points: Mohammed led followers to Jerusalem expecting an imminent apocalypse, considerably later Abd al-Malik (the fifth caliph) would re-root Islam with a written Qur'an and greater emphasis on Mohammed, Mecca, and Arabic language.<br/>
Moving dates from Uthman to al-Malik is 50 years - not super long in the company of Christian Gospels and apocrypha. Not enough for carbon dating to be all that relevant?

The mainstream belief is that al-Malik and his viceroy oversaw a handful of letter changes, added the dots distinguishing letters (such as ن vs. ت), and introduced diacritics. I found Shoemaker's interpretation of these agreed-on changes, and other supposed discrepancies, to be misleading. For example Wikipedia treats a theory of Mecca and [Bakkah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakkah) as separate places as fringe, and describes a Dome of the Rock issue as "mainly changes from the first to the third person".

The revisionist movement generally believes that sections of the Qur'an were written outside of the Hijaz (Mecca and Medina).  Mohammed *can* be placed in the region through the [Constitution of Medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Medina). Mecca has been portrayed as a center of trade routes, possibly for mining or leatherwork, but this is not supported. Moving the writing to Syria could explain descriptions of fishing and familiarity with Christian figures.<br/>

There are also chapters on eyewitness memory (psych 101) and 20th-century studies of oral recitation in Yugoslavia and Ghana (new to me).

### Some Tangents

Two academic presentations challenging the al-Malik theory:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8TUNGq8zQ
- https://xcancel.com/PhDniX/status/1780525455466004838

Online communities talk about mysteries of the Qur'an, such as [muqattaʿat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqatta%CA%BFat) (letters which appear at the start of some surahs), the identity of the [Sabians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabians), and hapax (words which appear once in the text and sometimes nowhere else in Arabic lexicon, such as [kalāla](https://www.academia.edu/18627654/)).

Mohammad's uncle Abu Lahab and his wife are [condemned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masad) in the Qur'an for reasons not fully detailed. It doesn't make the Wikipedia article, but there's also a story that Abu Lahab's son got eaten by a lion?

A 1941 short story included in *I, Robot* features a robot uprising reciting the Islamic statement of faith. A few years later Asimov introduced 'the Mule', a mind-controlling conqueror who the old prophets failed to foresee, to the Foundation series. This [isn't a unique observation](https://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2014/novdec/foundation-and-empire.html).<br/>
Reddit posts about Mohammed, Napoleon, and others have found lore that the Mule was suggested by an editor, or that Asimov said he was based on the Mongol conqueror [Tamerlane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur) in the classic *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*. His planet (Kalgan) was the Mongolian name of a city in present-day China. So maybe I don't know anything!

Diacritics were added to the Torah in about the same century as al-Malik's work.

        <i>Maybe Happy Ending</i> announced a famous white actor as the first replacement for Darren Criss, igniting debate among actors and fans. In what ways is MHE an Asian-American musical? Was that the creators' intent, and was that embedded in cultivating their online fanbase and promoting the show for awards?<br/>
        The story is complicated by framing of the announcement (the actor is the lead actress's real-life boyfriend), their past searches for Asian understudies, and the future of local productions (I'm sure production talked about casting when planning the national tour!).
    </li>

I was watching a YouTuber react to the <i>Men in Black</i> trilogy and that first movie is just quintessential NYC, made at just the right time where they could do CGI but had to film on location, 1997 so they can be irreverent about NYC, the NYPD, and the military.<br/>
Sci-fi often falls into the <i>Gulliver's Island</i> / <i>Doctor Who</i> / colonial fiction trap of: our characters are the only humans in a land of weird aliens. Despite the obvious symbolism of the MIB patrolling New York, their ethos is very 'live and let live'. The first movie opens by mocking Border Patrol, agents get to know aliens through their home culture, and their recruitment process <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_r3ULoXuMY">screens for empathy</a>.<br/>
If I had to reboot MIB for the 30th anniversary, I think you do a miniseries, writers from <i>Interior: Chinatown</i> would tear this up, that border patrol guy is now riding around in an ICE MRAP.

    After a mass stabbing at a Michigan Wal-Mart, a former classmate and a sibling of the attacker posted their stories on social media including in comments of a court video. He had a reaction to 'poisoned' drugs during high school and never recovered. The family has struggled with recent care home closures.<br/>
I don't see the 'true crime' environment fully shifting, but reading more stories has changed my feelings about viewing. Also influenced by the Karen Read trial not ending (Emily Baker interviewed someone from Read's defense and livestreams other trials which could be embarrassing to the prosecutor).

- Reddit were saying both the Library of Alexandria and the libraries in Baghdad were not as damaged as represented in popular history
- Saw my first duckbill USPS trucks outside Denver
- Justice Robert Jackson appears in an upcoming *Nuremberg* movie
- I watched a new reaction video for *Star Wars*. The couple were familiar with *Dune* and though that's a known inspiration, they zeroed in on a few phrases (spice mines, dune sea) which I never noticed.
- In my Hong Kong blog I wrote a little blurb about Station Square. I completely whiffed on it being Kai Tak, the location of the old airport. It's taken a very long time to redevelop: the cruise terminal opened in 2013, the subway in 2020, and a stadium earlier this year. [A monorail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_Friendly_Linkage_System) along the former runway has been designed, cancelled, and revived.
- Denver narrowly rejects RCV https://denverite.com/2025/08/12/denver-city-council-ranked-choice-fails/
- During an overnight bike trip, I watched regular TV, and discovered the spinoff *Naked and Afraid of Love* - just a fever dream within a fever dream. The 20-something contestants constantly use what I would call "therapy speak". But in this case I don't mean making excuses and saying 'boundaries', but always describing an experience as conceptually good, instead of acknowledging that they are experiencing and emoting.
- Back in January I mentioned the 'evil Alexa' movie *AfrAId*. Recently the director (better known for work on *The Golden Compass* and *Rogue One*) was on the Blank Check podcast for a Coen brothers movie. He described studio meddling, test audiences being asked "was anything confusing?", a botched release producing "a movie that doesn't exist", etc. So I learned a little about *AfrAId*.
- [Experiences from teachers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1m8rurv/were_starting_yondr_pouches_this_year_what/) after Yondr bags adopted in schools.
- I'm close to fixing Simplified and Traditional Chinese labels on OpenStreetMap's new vector tile layers. While fixing this for MapLibre's next release, I got changes into Tiny-SDF and Node-Canvas =)
- I am just learning about OpenFreeMap, a free vector tile service leveraging Cloudflare.
- Three buildings had lobby windows shattered during a practice for Chicago's annual Air and Water Show. In videos on Chicago and aviation subreddits, one jet is out of view when there's a loud bang. Although it's likely this was caused by the flyover in some form, the military specifically denied that any jet flew supersonic.
