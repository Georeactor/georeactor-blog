This past week was a little exciting as I went peak-unemployed and made a podcast. It's a little funny that NotebookLM has launched with a podcast demo feature around the same time, so I'll discuss them in one post.

My podcast topic is a developing news story which I posted before on the blog: [fugitive mayor Alice Guo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt48J5Vp6upFiZScZsFwHjk7CDWHIOaLi). After becoming a minor celebrity and villain in the Philippines, their Senate and House held hours and hours of hearings. That's content!<br/>
When I made the first episode, it was an experiment for me to get all the audio software and an external mic (which I've had since 2022). Reading from a script with intention was an improvement on presentations which I've recorded in the past. Conceptually I thought of the audience as someone like my cousin, who has no other exposure to this story. So it was a bit of a surprise when YouTube kept recommending it to Filipinos.<br/>
The second episode was smoother in planning and recording. I think it's one of the best pieces of media that I've created!

Creating this content is a bit too obscure and hyper-focus-y. There's a 4chan post (hopefully fake) where someone's grandfather obsesses over Rwanda conspiracies, even though his family has no connection to the country. If I can keep the podcast episodes to 10 minutes with mostly Filipino primary sources, I think that we're in the green zone.<br/>
The third episode process was not as fluid. I was happy assembling updates and video links into a script over a few days, but wasn't as confident when I read it aloud the next day. Mania / hyperfocus wearing off? Another issue was that I summarized the updates too much (Al-Jazeera had the Chinese agent record a warning in Mandarin for Alice, but I didn't want to include it, then me reading the subtitles, then me talking about it).<br/>
And there's something funny about how Cassandra is in a totally different movie, but I'm not sure that I nailed it in this episode.

Now for NotebookLM - it's a UI to collect documents and media to feed a long-context LLM, and includes a feature to generate a 'podcast' dialogue. voices and dynamic remind me of the 'Armchair Expert' podcast. No one else Tweeted this yet, so I'm probably wrong.<br/>
First I heard about this demo as a tool for praising your own GitHub or homepage (which it does well) but I wanted to go meta and explore my own podcast. <br/>
There's a suggestion to let the app generate a timeline, and that feature worked really well (considering it's multiple websites and audio clips).<br/>
When I gave NotebookLM the links to my first two YouTube episodes, it did a decent job of summarizing the content (except for pronouncing POGOs, "Pee.Oh.Jos"). I have subtitles for each episode, but the third episode is too recent and the app wouldn't accept it (?).<br/>
Then I added Wikipedia, news stories, the third episode transcript, and a couple of other videos for context. BBC and CNN are forbidden. With this additional context, the topics got too disparate and repetitive, especially around platitudes (she was like a wholesome farmer, big money is sketchy, in this globalized world, will she actually face trial, transparent government is important).<br/>
NotebookLM  likes to up the ante and call Alice a 'double agent'. And as much as I like when the AI hosts sound human, I don't like when they claim human experiences like "I saw her name pop up somewhere" or an aside that a specific interviewer is "really tough".<br/>
Finally I removed most sources and uploaded all three episodes as MP3s. I could see that  they did a good job of transcribing and summarizing Filipino text (including a TikTok video that I'd downloaded).<br/>
The new version of the 'podcast' revolved around my Episode 2 (because it has English at the start, or from the Friends & Foes title?). The narration oddly starts in Alice's shoes ('you're the mayor of this totally normal town and now you're in the middle of an international incident') - when the obvious narrative is that you're a normal person wondering if your mayor is an international cybercriminal spy.

Real talk on the analytics - the podcast is getting almost all of its audience on YouTube.
- the viewers are mostly coming from the YouTube homepage, so before the algorithm picks up an episode and after it stops promoting it, I have about 0 views
- the click-through rate is high (7–14%) but the average viewer doesn't stick around long; they expect a video or new content
- even if all 1,600 viewers of Episode 3 had gone as far as watching the whole episode and then the whole series and then subscribed, these are baby numbers on YouTube

Part of this goes back to a ramble that I've had before. It supposedly doesn't matter to an artist who sees or likes their art. But when I make an online course, or upload this podcast, it's going to be significant if there is no student or listener. Or if I've unintentionally made low quality clickbait.

I could see repurposing these skills for an AI-voice radio script for a future topic or fiction. Or maybe I need some help from AI research and voices to make a series of SE Asian true crime / political podcasts?
More seriously, I think the next steps are going to be:

- Episode 4 could cover the weirdness around arresting and extraditing Alice Guo (international law tie-in!). Including the drug trafficker that Indonesia wanted in an exchange, or a recently-captured cult leader on the American most wanted list.
- I rediscovered by PostGIS Workshop agenda from January 2020 so I could resume recording tutorials.
- TV host / influencer Karen Bordador, who was jailed in the same dorm as Alice Guo (before being acquitted!), returned to YouTube with [a quality video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZoEUGCYz5Q)
