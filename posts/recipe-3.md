Part 3, holiday wrap-up.

## Meals

### Apple Pie Cookies

https://www.munchiesbymallory.com/post/apple-pie-cookies

Saw it on Instagram. This was my first time buying pie crust.
Go to Trader Joe's or somewhere, and the freezer section will have a long box like you'd have for aluminum foil. **Pie crust, NOT pie shells**. Let the crust defrost a bit before you unroll it, or it'll break into small pieces and you need to re-roll it.

### Baked Spaghetti

Baked pasta was never something we had at home, but I went through a phase trying it at pizza places. This was my first time cooking it.

I don't have a baking dish and used a square oven-safe pot (making it effectively 70% recipe). At the last minute I decided to use cubed tempeh instead of bison or beef. Then I discovered the ricotta I'd gotten at Whole Foods was vegan ='(. Anyway, soldiered on. End result was alright, just not great.

### Boursin Omelette (Sydney's omelette from The Bear)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSOuWhCsYfE

I didn't follow the recipe so closely (for example, using blue tortilla chips). Boursin is new to me, you can find it in a regular grocery near cream cheese, and makes for a nice omelette filling.

### Boursin Orzo with Chicken

https://www.saltandlavender.com/boursin-orzo/

Instead of meat, I boiled tempeh then fried to be crispier [as described here](https://sunbasket.com/recipe/barcelona-orzo-salad-with-tempeh-patatas-bravas).<br/>
I am still using cheese and chicken stock, so it's not veg-topia here.<br/>
This was tasty! Though I'm not sure if the cheese isn't just adding heavy cream to the pot with extra steps.

### Butter Salmon Curry

Added zucchini based on site's related menu. The recipe is for four pieces of salmon. I ended up making a half-recipe and dividing that into two meals.

### Chili Crisp Bucatini

https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chili-crisp-bucatini

Blend of carbonara ingredients with a scoop of chili crisp. Get a good jar of chili crisp! Made this along with "orzotto alla carbonara" to use up the pancetta.

I don't know if bucatini is super important for the recipe. I had been holding on to some for a while, Googled 'chili crisp bucatini', and every site has a copy of this recipe, originating in James Park's book *Chili Crisp*.

### Lamb Kofta Curry

https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/fragrant-lamb-kofta-curry

Made the meatballs mostly from [this recipe](http://www.thismuslimgirlbakes.com/2018/11/lamb-kofta-curry.html?m=1) and froze half for later. Inspired by [suki_curries_spices](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cfs95mrj74Y/), but when I was on the Threads app I couldn't find the original recipe.

I have a lot of TVP from Bob's Red Mill, and want to try [veggie meatballs](https://sarahsvegankitchen.com/recipes/easy-meatballs-with-tvp/) in the future.

### Orzotto alla Carbonara

https://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/a-fast-foolproof-carbonara-recipe-for-orzo-lovers/

This makes sense as a recipe, combining orzo-in-chicken-stock with carbonara ingredients.

### Paneer Makhani

https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/paneer-makhani-paneer-makhanwala-recipe/

First time with this recipe - when it comes to home cooking, the difference between this, butter masala, and kadai paneer is that I can blend the canned tomato and cashews at the beginning, instead of frying the ingredients, cooling, food processor, then cooking.

### Sausage-Stuffed Biscuits

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OESWD1OJb0s

There are a ton of *Girl Meets Farm* episodes. Based on this recipe I put chorizo inside store biscuits, and some added a pinch of Mexican cheese blend.<br/>
She also has an Italian-meatballs-inside-biscuits recipe.

Some notes: Make small meatballs (I used around 1/2 pound of chorizo for 8 biscuits). Biscuits now have air fryer instructions, so make sure you follow the oven temperature. I had to carefully stretch out the biscuits into disks to cover the meatball without compacting or overstretching it.

### Spicy Meatballs with Chickpeas

https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020975-spicy-meatballs-with-chickpeas

Made with the other half-pound of lamb from the kofta meatballs recipe, reduced to one can/box of chickpeas.

Added a dried ancho chile to simmer with the meatballs, then after giving the chickpeas some heat in olive oil, added them for the last 5+ minutes.

## Some Fails

### Pane Bianco

https://ahintofrosemary.com/recipes/pane-bianco/

This might've been a fail as I didn't have the foil to tent it and the top got blackened and it wasn't that Instagrammable.

### Toor Dal (Split Yellow Pigeon Peas)

https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020907-toor-dal-split-yellow-pigeon-peas

This was alright. I don't have an immersion blender, so I whisked a lot. In the end of the final step there are still individual peas with some hardness. I returned with more water, mashed it with a spoon, before cooking for longer. In the future, be prepared for this to take an hour or more.

### Vegan Japanese Curry with Red Lentils

https://www.ellielikes.cooking/vegan-japanese-curry-with-red-lentils/

Typically I use the S&B golden curry blocks. The first steps of this recipe give steps to combine Japanese curry powder and flour to make a roux. I ordered Japanese curry online, and it turned out to already be roux-ified (vegan, gluten-free with millet flour). So shop based on description and not the $/ounce

I didn't use zucchini or apple.

This was partly timing, but I wasn't in a hurry to finish the leftovers, so overall mid.

## Asides

[@minc798](https://twitter.com/minc798) consistently Tweets about restaurant openings in Chicago. Egg Tuck is about to open near me  =)

I got a packet of kaniwa/ca√±ihua, which is a less domesticated relative of quinoa. Interested in trying it in the rice cooker.

At the beginning of the year I watched [a video on Li-Lac Chocolates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsqOlHXzDg), and bought a packet of candy for the holidays.

## Kitchen Goals Update

I bought pork tenderloin to make the full katsu curry rice.

Still in the todo column:

- Making chocolates from scratch
- The Tom Cruise white chocolate coconut cake
