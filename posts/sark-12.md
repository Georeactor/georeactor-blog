CNN has [an article](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/23/tech/new-emoji-2024/index.html) about upcoming emoji,
with a brief mention of Sark. This prompted many TV news conglomerates to show Emojipedia's emoji designs this week.<br/>
Typically they introduce the bags-under-eyes emoji, and refer to the root vegetable and the "climate change" rationale for the leafless tree. If you want to see a dozen versions of this story, search "eight new emojis" on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>
One where I found Sark-related banter was CBS Pittsburgh from 8:20: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPz475I5gBc&t=8m20s <br/>
Also on WFSB Connecticut: "I told Karen that we should take the Great Day shows to Sark" and English accents from 5:00; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-89DfVjPTw&t=300s <br/>
Shorter asides from:
- Fox St Louis: "Have you heard of that, John, Sark?" "One of my favorite places to visit" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz01kUvPaII
- 6ABC Philadelphia: "I didn't even know Sark existed." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO131AWlrgc <br/>
- CBS Minnesota: "Did not know that existed." (long discussion about purple splat and whether it could be used for the Vikings) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHYBzJGWrTM

Here's a more representative 30-second piece where Sark is not mentioned at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qli_9-RETD0

Here's an Italian YouTube short on new emoji with 127k views: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssj2WRkMVGc

Dutch outlets (AD.nl, De Gelderlander, De Stentor, Tubantia, and Eindhovens Dagblad) ran a story
about the Sark emoji. After I registered my email, I was able to read these islander reactions (translated back into English):

> "Oh really? Our flag is getting its own emoji? This is the first time I've heard that," island resident Elizabeth Perree responds enthusiastically.
> [...] "When people see that flag, they'll wonder: which country does this flag belong to? That might lead them to delve deeper into the island and consider coming here for a holiday"<br/>
> [...]<br/>
> John Donnelly (69), who has lived on Sark since 1976 and has several holiday homes, calls it ‘great news’. “People are becoming so curious about the island and will probably come here more quickly. We are looking forward to it.”<br/>
> [...]<br/>
> Jess Hester (74), owner of four holiday homes, is also enthusiastic. [...] “It is a good move to introduce this flag on social media. Our island could use some publicity.”
