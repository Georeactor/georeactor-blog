Last fall I posted about "[Living Streets of OpenStreetMap US](https://mapmeld.medium.com/living-streets-of-openstreetmap-us-cdba802356eb)". In Las Vegas, I encountered two pedestrian streets (tagged with highway=pedestrian),  and they're in an outdoor mall.

The next aisle over, by the Panera, is a walkable area tagged with benches but doesn't have highway=pedestrian. I mapped a bike rack.<br/>
There's also a splash pad on the map, which isn't in any of the standard OSM renderers.

Shortly after I posted about bikes in northern Wisconsin / Lake Superior area, I found [BicycleBenefits.org](https://bicyclebenefits.org/) through the local co-op. Get discounts!

While visiting Moab, I corrected the new Utah Raptor state park to "Utahraptor", and added two sculptures downtown ("Get Your Mind Rolling" was memorable).

I added some local businesses, parking access roads, residential access roads in a new development, etc. There are a good number of bike racks in national parks which ought to be mapped.

East of Borneo, [Sebatik Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebatik_Island) is divided between Malaysia and Indonesia. Local attractions include a pool and house which cross the border! But there seems to be limited cross-border traffic and development.
