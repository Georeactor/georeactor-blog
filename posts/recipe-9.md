## Meals

### Chilaquiles omelette

A little mushy. Good with manchego cheese.

### Grasspea soup

The grasspea or cicerchie is one of the first foods used in agriculture, and one of the most resilient
in droughts. The plant is slightly toxic which means it shouldn't be used as a subsistence crop, but here
it works as a soup with pork and veggies.

### Green egg curry

Despite Instagram and YouTube claims, this probably isn't authentically an "Afghani" recipe.
Hard boiled eggs plus a lot of coriander and a bit of green chili. There was a lot of coriander going into
my food processor before it looked green enough, so you might have to mess with the ingredients.

### Lamb burger

Made with couscous instead of burger buns. Probably only needs half of an onion.

### Matar paneer kofta

Looked up a video recipe after seeing some variations on Instagram. This replaces meatballs with a grated paneer and
flour mixture. Some other recipes include potato. This recipe has garlic, so it isn't totally Jain-friendly. I'm
working on finding some recipes for that.

## Asides

Made the New York Times tuna melt with Trader Joe's cracked wheat sourdough - I think this works!

New Mie Gacoan noodle restaurants are opening across Indonesia, including in the neighborhood where I stayed in Makassar! It's a good fit.

Bought a bag of fresh peas, which I ate once as they started to sprout. Tried with ramen. Canned peas are more consistent.

Bought precooked pulled pork from Trader Joe's. This was disappointing compared to the pork belly. I mixed it into spicy mac & cheese and it had the texture of tuna mac.

## Kitchen Goals Update

I'd like to make little manti Turkish/Iranian dumplings like I had in Cyprus.
