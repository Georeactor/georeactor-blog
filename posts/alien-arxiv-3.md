    <h4>A 4–8 GHz Galactic Center Search for Periodic Technosignatures</h4>
    <p>
Radio searches for extraterrestrial intelligence have mainly targeted the discovery of narrowband continuous-wave beacons and artificially dispersed broadband bursts. [...] A rotating beacon at the Galactic Center (GC), in particular, would be highly advantageous for galaxy-wide communications.
    </p>
    </a>

Authors publish `blipss` software to search for periodic narrowband signals in radio data. The idea is to look for these artificial pulsars and remove noise and natural pulsars. The authors were particularly interested in finding a beacon in the center of the Milky Way.

They did not find one.

'Oumuamua continues to be a point of fascination. I don't have access to the full paper on this, but this is one of a few papers continuing to analyze the object's acceleration while leaving the Solar System.

Here (in *Nature*) the authors believe it is outgassing but the previous inconclusive examples were wrong about what gas / what process was at work.

    <h4>Could AI be the Great Filter? What Astrobiology can Teach the Intelligence Community about Anthropogenic Risks</h4>
    <p>
Where is everybody? This phrase distills the foreboding of what has come to be known as the Fermi Paradox - the disquieting idea that, if extraterrestrial life is probable in the Universe, then why have we not encountered it? [...] From an intelligence perspective, framing global catastrophic risk (particularly risks of anthropogenic origin) within the context of the Great Filter can provide insight into the long-term futures of technologies that we don't fully understand, like artificial intelligence.

Here, Bailey examines the idea that the Fermi paradox (lack of alien signals) is due to a Great Filter event caused by AI. He also considers war or climate change (filters occurring after the development of civilization).

We also get a section about DALL-E, and the discovery of "Loab" in its latent space. This is a particularly interesting example but maybe not the most clear for discussing model explainability or hallucinations.

He concludes with suggesting the US and the intelligence community could do more to take catastrophic risk seriously and show leadership in pausing AI development.

    <h4>Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence: The Final Existential Risk?</h4>
    <p>
    The possibility that artificial extraterrestrial intelligence poses an existential threat to humanity is neglected. It is also the case in economics, where both AI existential risks and the potential long-term consequences of an AGI are neglected.

Meanwhile from the IZA (Institute of Labor Economics), another paper on AI risk and aliens.

> At the time of writing, 2023, the alignment problem has NOT been solved.

The paper build a chain of citations to argue that 40 years after building an AI superintelligence, it will form a Singleton (one central decision-maker for the planet), which will have an imperative to colonize the galaxy and strike first at other civilizations, due to the Dark Forest hypothesis (Liu's novel is quoted here).

The paper does consider alternatives, such as a Percolation Model that the Earth is in a more desolate region of space, and a paper by Michael Lampton (*Information-driven societies and Fermi's paradox*) that advanced civilizations may find it more efficient to observe other planets rather than visiting them.

    <h4>Faculty perceptions of unidentified aerial phenomena</h4>
    <p>
Recently, former and current government officials, legislators, and faculty in the United States have called for research on what their government terms Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP, now called Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena). Investigative journalism, military reports, new government offices, and scholarship have piqued broad attention.
    </p>

A cool survey to appear in *Nature*. With responses from nearly 1,500 faculty (out of 40,000 contacted) across several universities and disciplines. I found this through its mention of the late Senator Harry Reid, who said some wild shit about UAPs and extraterrestrial materials.

About 1/3 of faculty were still unaware of *New York Times* articles and Pentagon reports about UAP. Only 2% had read select scholarly articles about the topic. There's a fairly even divide in belief that the media, military industrial complex, or 'all humanity' will benefit from openness about UAP. For a near-majority of respondents, government sources or 'meta-analysis' would be the most compelling evidence of an alien intelligence being responsible. They also generally do not investigate UAP because it is outside of their research field, but would be open if a respected member in their field began working in this space.

There's also a table of personal observations of UAPs. It's not discussed in the paper, but these generally happened around family, and/or when the respondent was a child.<br/>

    <p>
In preceding papers, Project Lyra has covered many possible trajectory options available to a spacecraft bound for 1I/Oumuamua, including Solar Oberth manoeuvres, Passive Jupiter encounters, Jupiter Oberths, Double Jupiter Gravitational Assists, etc.

In [the previous Aliens of Arxiv](/alien-arxiv-2), I included a paper about launching a probe to catch up to 'Oumuamua. The author produced a new paper recently, comparing rockets from SpaceX, the ESA, and China for practically delivering this probe.

    <h4>The Search for Extraterrestrial Civilizations: A Scientific, Technical, Political, Social, and Cultural Adventure</h4>
    <p>
    I review the scientific and technical history of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), discuss the impact of the political involvement, and speculate on the nature of a successful detection and its potential social and cultural impact. Emphasis is on the development of SETI in the United States and the complementary progress in the Former Soviet Union.

I didn't get super into this paper, but it does cover a few events in the Soviet Union's interest in SETI or creating a radio beacon at the Lagrange point, which I haven't seen summarized elsewhere.
