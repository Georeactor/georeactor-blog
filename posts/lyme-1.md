Via Reddit, I learned about an ongoing mystery where Australian health officials are researching tick-borne illness, but deny popular claims that the patients have caught Lyme disease locally.
This is my American-oriented deep dive.

Articles by Prof Richard Russell in 1993-1995 appear in JSTOR and CDC archives and trace Australia's first Lyme reports to 1982-1986. Patients tested in the 90s have "antibody response… but none of these results were confirmed by immunoblotting". After collecting thousands of wild ticks, no carriers were found. [In a 2010 news article](https://www.smh.com.au/national/lyme-mystery-ticks-all-the-boxes-20100723-10ora.html), a scientist from this study commented that Lyme-carrying tick species "weren't here then and they wouldn't be here now".

The Lyme Disease Association of Australia was founded in 2009. They often cite [a 2011 case report](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22267937/) which claims patients had never left their states on eastern and western coasts of Australia.<br/>
A government inquiry into "Lyme-like illness" engaged with patients in 2013–2016. That report (with support by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia) led to a small wave of attention and research: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5441348/

Murdoch University (based in Western Australia) collected ticks around 2015–2022 for study and catalogued bacteria which often co-infect with Lyme bites in other countries. https://tickstudy.murdoch.edu.au

A 2016 news article warns that scammers convince  patients to order a diagnosis from unaccredited labs: https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/the-great-australian-lyme-conspiracy/news-story/c5137170015f20db705febcf56223af6

In 2018  the sickness was re-labeled as "Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT)" . https://lymedisease.org.au/chronology/  https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/dscatt/about .<br/>
Here's a DSCATT poster from Murdoch University researchers in 2022:

The subject continues to be in the public discourse, with the health.gov.au page being updated in January. A right-wing, climate-change-denying politician posted about Lyme as a nation-wide health crisis this April.

Social media speculates about DSCATT being a combination of foreign-acquired illness, and more rare allergies and reactions. It could also be that tick bites contain new or unstudied bacteria, or be related to ongoing mysteries over chronic Lyme.<br/>
These diseases could be rare within Lyme patients in the US, but stand out in Australia where there are supposed to be zero Lyme-like cases.<br/>
It's also possible that there's something worth deep research in Western Australia? Multiple patients have been public about bites in 2006-2009, before this was in the public discourse.
