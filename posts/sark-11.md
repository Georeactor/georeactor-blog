As reported by [Emojipedia](https://blog.emojipedia.org/google-debuts-emoji-16-0-support/),
Google's Noto Color Emoji font now supports Sark and other Unicode 16.0 emoji in the embed and download
available on Google Fonts. I've updated this site accordingly. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¶

This virtually guarantees that Apple will support a Sark emoji in early 2025.

Two notes:
- they have the official/correct flag with the lions contained in the top-left corner, not overlapping the cross as in the Seigneur's version
- no changes were made in the noto-emoji repo on GitHub, where I had been expecting updates. LOL
